“I know,” said Harry. “But could you have just taken the wand that made him look like a rag doll?”

“Yes,” said Hermione, looking very pleased. “So this wand and the look on it from Professor Snape’s head aside...” 

“Let’s try again?” said Harry.

“It’s a bit too early to tell,” said Hermione, her eyes shining.

“Just one more question then,” said Harry. “Please’re up as soon as I can.”

“What do you mean ?” said Hermione, looking very disconcerted. “Do you want to see what Professor Snape’s
looking at?”

“What — what is this thing ?”

Hermione’s face rose into the air.

“It’s not a wand,” said Harry coldly. “It’s a
scratch-blower and a wand that makes those spots on the
bottom of your nose look like tiny hairs.”

“I see’s that,” said Hermione, “and I saw your face
before.”

“What’s with that,” said Harry, looking at her. “I saw your face
before.”

“I was bitten by a rat, Harry?”

“But Voldemort didn’t touch my face,” said Harry.
“He’s got a rat,” said Hermione.

“Oh,” said Harry. “One rat inside me.”

“Or am I mistaken?”

“Yes,” said Hermione, pushing her glasses into the bag.

“I called you Bill about a rat,” said Harry, pulling out
the wand.

“It’s a long-range rat,” said Hermione, lowering her glasses. “I’ve never seen
one.”

the

Potter went off in an uproar, leaving the
Master, Barty, and Gudmund, and after a
unfortunate scene at the feast, there sprang up three
and four others who — and the
Smugglers — were now attacking Harry.

“Where did you hear that?” Barty called. “Come on, let’s go, okay? We really need to
find out who’s flying them.”

“The Headmaster — wouldn’t you put things together to
try and stop that?” Mr. Weasley said again, waving
himself around at the crowd. “He might have missed it,
maybe he even forgot it, but I’m sure he
came in the first place because he’s in command, that’s right!”

Harry heard him muttering to Goyle, who was
walking toward them, and then he saw a pair of
horses — which were looking down on them.

“Dandruff the Goat!” Mr. Weasley said, waving a hand in his lap,
“And a dog,” Mr. Weasley repeated but not.

“The Headmaster — can’t you see the dog? It’s gone!”

“The Headmaster is scared of this!” shouted Goyle. “He’s my
soul mate!”

“And they’ve got his head,” Mr. Weasley said. “No, we’re not in possession —
”

“What, the Headmaster?” Mr. Weasley piped up. “Pupils! Kittens — ”

The headmaster was standing there glancing at Harry,
muttering over his shoulder.

“Thinks he’m supposed to be in there, Professor?”

“If it’s just you and me,” Mr. Weasley said.

“Then stop it, tell Professor — ”

A moment later, Mr. Weasley put
---------------

What if we left him behind in the forest?”

“I’m sure you’ll find it soon,” said Percy seriously. “And live.
I want to,’leaves the moment alone ’s right.”

“I’m very glad you’ve got the cold off your chest,” said
Hermione incredulously. “Don’t worry, it won’t hurt.”

“It won’t hurt,” said Ron.

“Maybe it’ll open up more,” said Harry.

“Oh, yeah, but I’m in the hospital wing,” Hermione said
with a smile. “It’s an odd thing that you don’t
think you’ll get in very soon.”

“I certainly think you’ll get that,” said Percy, looking into
Hermione’s eyes. “I mean, ”

“And you can walk in the cold,” said Percy, staring
straight into the empty hall, “I’ll be able to.”

Harry looked up at Ron as though he was going to
stop himself.

“I heard something in there somewhere,” he said,
turning toward the door. “What is it?”

“A dream,” said Harry. “It’s a dream, it’s an odd thing
that we’ve been having. But it’s very vivid.”


A few seconds later, Harry saw Ron
breathing heavily again, his eyes outstretched, his
neck slightly too badly bent.

“The dream, I hope,” said Ron, “is a dream of sorts.
And when Harry woke up this morning, I looked
for Voldemort. I went back to the hospital wing, I
saw the dark and shadowy figures walking around nowhere.
“Harry,” said Ron a little bitterly.

“Come in,
---------------


“Haven’t any of you seen anything?” asked Ron, patting Hagrid on the head.

“Well, no, I haven’t seen anything yet,” said Hagrid quickly. “If we can find a way
out of this. Then what’s you got to do?”

“You’re not alone,” said Harry. “All the while I
had thought I was back. There’s only one place I can go
anything.”

“So you’re back again?” said Neville.

“No, I’m just down there,” said Hagrid.

“Yes,” said Harry, looking around. “We’ll need to talk a bit, and he
told me to stay here.”

Harry looked up at the lake.

“He said he’ll stay here,” said Ron. “He told me, I said
that you’re going back to Quidditch, but you’re not
back with Draco Malfoy. He’s been lying
to me. I wonder what happened?"

“There are bad things happening in here, aren’t they?” said Harry
very quietly.

“There are some bad things happening here,” said Ron,
writing. “The Lockhart family are leaving their
houses. Careful, try and keep your eyes.”

“You’re right,” Dumbledore said. “I haven’t seen —
I’ll have to tell you something; I’m sure you’ll hold an
examination of yourself while you’re with the family and
return to Azkaban.”

Harry was already sat on the trolley, giving
him the odd look of impatience.

“You’re not,” said Dumbledore. “No, I am. You were
looking at the Daily Prophet when you’re
saying that the Lockhart family are leaving
---------------

“You’re not sure whether I’m safe,
you know?”

“Yeah,” said Borgin, to the others, “I’m not sure,”

“Can’t you stand,” said Hermione, who was quite
oblivious to Harry’s words. “We all know about
Snape’s head, but I bet you’d like to go and look behind
the hall.”

“Oh, well!” said Ron. “Don’t you reckon I’m still
the only one there?”

“Even a fellow Slytherin?” said Hermione. “Riddle,”

“Look at that gleaming beard!” said Ron angrily. He was
wearing a black cloak, the Slytherin cloak
was as gleaming as the one Ron had once worn.

“That’s how I got into your head,” said Ron. “You seem to love
the scar.”

“Yeah,” said Hermione.
“Yeah,” said Harry, shaking her head.

“But who can say whom?”

““Nobody,” said Ron.

“I’m very lucky though,” said Hermione, “I suppose
you just wanted to see how it felt.”

“Well, I wish I could have just listened to you,” said
Hermione, who was now looking quite lost for
time. “Never mind,” she continued, as though
her temper were high. “So what were you doing at the time? I
was going to tell you my mum’s supposed to help me
protect myself, Harry, but I’m not sure what I’d
say. We’ll have to do it, I suppose.”

Harry leaned forward, his heart pounding.

“You know, it’s the trickiest thing,” he said.
---------------


“Now that she’s back, you’re going to have to head over to your brother’s house and talk to him.”

Harry wiped at his face and pulled the Seeker’s Cloak open.

“You’ve got one of the Seeker’s,” said Hermione. “You could let us
do this. You don’d have to be afraid of us anymore.”

“So?” muttered Harry.

“Well, I’m not scared,” said Hermione quickly.

“I’m certainly not afraid, is it?”

“I’m not scared,” said Harry, looking as pale as he
could. “I’ve done nothing in three years, I’ve done everything.”

“Didn’t you know what you were talking about before ?”
said Hermione, sounding as though her voice were
increasing.

“What was it that you said you had been messing with ?”

“It’s very important,” said Ron.

“Voldemort’s got the power to see everything,” said Hermione.

“But that’s what he wants from me,” said Ron, not looking
at Hermione closely. “When we were attacking him, we
had made promises to Draco Malfoy.”

Harry glanced around at the Gryffindor table, which
was full of people watching them and watching the
Scabbers.

“I’m not sure what you’re talking about,” said Ron.

“What if we’d done that again? Voldemort’s not
going to show up in time, and I wouldn’t get our
rogue partners back on our side now.”

Harry was very grateful to be here. He had not
seen them all the way back to Gryffindor Tower until
last summer when they were looking around the room for
their hexes.

“It’s not a secret,” said Charlie. “Most people who know James know something’s gone wrong.”

“It’s Professor Snape.” said George, who had pulled the elf’s
tail.

“Who are you?” said Sirius, who was looking as
excited as Harry had ever seen him.

“My name’s Igor, Professor Snape,” said Harry.

“I’m a Slytherin, good luck, Professor. I’d better get
out of my head than you.”

Professor Snape turned toward Harry, who was frowning.

“Coming?” said George quietly. “What’s going on here?
“Oh, Harry, I’ve gone up this thicket with my
mother last time, and now I want to go back into the office,”
said Professor Snape. “I wanted to put my mother out of danger.
But oh, I — well, it’s all over now. Nobody’s seen
you. So what’s the matter?”

“Me, Ginny,” said Harry. “So, where’s Fred,
I have no idea how he got here, but he’s in the
Arithmancy Center, so he’s got to know how I’m
found out about the Dursleys.”

“Well, that’s not the whole story, Fred, no — not much,
” said George, and Harry watched as Professor Snape made
his way back into the room.

“Professor Snape was never a great wizard, Harry, he had a very
bad temper and really bad family. ...”

“You’re mad,” said George. “No one knows why he got even
a laugh at all. He’s got to know I’ve been
shooting, he’s always known about things. ...”

Professor Snape gave a long and withering
---------------


“D’you know, I’m not sure?” said Sirius. “I’m not sure I can help you, ...”

Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s faces became so pale that they lost their
breath.

“What's the matter?” said Ron angrily.

“I don’t know. Why?” said Harry, pointing at Harry and
Hermione.


“You’re not talking to me, aren’t you?” said Ron. “I watched you with
my wand.”

“Yeah,” said Hermione.

“I’ve taken a letter from Dumbledore, and he’s
getting ready to interrogate you from within the castle. As you
know, Dumbledore’s not very good at the Ministry, so I’m
going to put you in touch with your father if I can. He’ll be
looking for you, I hope. He is, Harry.”

Ron was smiling widely at Sirius’s enormous,
tortured face, which was clearly no longer
trouble.

“I know what the letter says,” said Harry, turning and
seeing Ron’s hair twist in its place. “”

“Er — I don’ suppose you’re right ...”

“Listen, Ron, I’m not sure that’s true, because it says I shouldn’t be
attention-getting. — You just expect me to be up to its
mind?”

“I was thinking,” said Harry, “that — ”

“Right,” replied Ron quietly, pointing him toward
Harry. “I suppose so. You know, Sirius, I’d like to ... see
you, right?”

“Well, I’m quite fine,” said Harry, “because there’s wonderful
snow outside, so I can walk down to it once in a
---------------


“You’ve been watching.” said Harry.

“Oh, I’m so lucky,” said Ron, taking his hand in
his pocket, waving it out at him. “What about us?”

“That’s not my problem,” said Ron. “I’m the only one who
can fix the problem.” He turned to look
at the ceiling. A few inches above him, a hundred
feet from the Great Hall, were six very bright red stars
laying over Ginny.

“You two,” said Harry, hoisting Ron up to his knees,
and bringing them in. “How did you go about
getting into the Great Hall, Miss Granger?”

“I’ve been researching the Quidditch team and
got a spot,” said Hermione, sitting up to
Harry’s feet.

“I spent a holiday there,” said Ron, who looked quite
bitterly. Harry followed.

“You — you two needn’t forget your D.A.’s?”

“I’m been thinking about it before,” said Hermione,
shaking her head. “You, you, you were here when I
was the only one not there.” She turned to look at
Harry as he walked toward the Great Hall.

“I — I’m going to give you a quick lesson, I think,
how you arrived here.”

“Thanks for the appointment,” said Ron. “I’d better not worry, though.”

“I thought you were supposed to be there,” said Hermione,
looking into Harry's swollen eyes, “but honestly, I
expected you two to be here and help me,”

“But you haven’t agreed,” said Ron.

“I said I’m sorry, I don’t care . . . and I’ve
been acting like this all year
---------------


“That’s okay,” said Ron.

“That’s a pretty good night,” said Hermione.

“Harry’s got a good night — ”

“Enough!” said Ron. “Go on — ”

“So, sir,” said Hermione, “when you think — ”
“You still
seemed like you wanted to be there, don’t you?”

“Yeah,” said Harry. “But I thought you just told me that,
so I didn’t look full of it,”

Harry shook his head. “And now you’ve got to go with
Professor Moody,”

“I didn’t like him —”

“I didn’t want to —”

“He’s not getting a go at me — ”

He turned with a twinkle, back to Borgin, “or
Professor Dumbledore,” and then to Ron.

“Professor Dumbledore,” said Ron, his voice low and low.

“But the Slytherins were not winning,”
said Hermione. “And Professor Dumbledore was
worse, indeed. He was certainly stronger than Professor Moody. And Professor
Moody’s not winning.”

“But why was Harry always so angry?”

“None of it is,” said Ron.

Hermione smiled. “He has more time in hell than I do.
I saw him when he was very young, and I got a glimpse of what
he thought had been happening —

“I think he was going to try and take advantage of you — ”

“But Dumbledore was the most shrewd of the Slytherins,” said
Ron grimly. “And you know why?”

“Because he had a whole branch of Slytherin he wanted
to control.” said Hermione with a smile. “Professor
